Row: each is a person
Column: each is a particular STR (DNA sequence that can be repeated)
    e.g. Alice, 28, 42, 14
    this shows that Alice has the STR in column 2 repeating 28 times (i.e. AGAT)

1) Open CSV file and read contents into memory
    1st row of 1st column called "name" (need to skip it?)
        skip 1st column and 1st row
    every remaining row is a person
    csv module has reader and DictReader for reading csv's
        as lists or dictionaries respectively
    sys module has sys.argv for command line arguments
    open text file with open(filename)
    read file f with f.read()
3) Compute longest run of all STR's in current DNA sequence
    iterate through DNA sequence, one position at a time,
        until find a DNA sequence
    compute how many times STR repeats starting at current postion
        check each successive substring until STR no longer repeats
        len(s) built into python to find length of string s
        s[i:j] takes string s and returns substring with all chars
            from ith char up to, but not including jth char
4) Compare STR counts against each row in CSV file
    i) save sTR counts into a data structure, see very top set of comments)
    i) for each row in data, check if STR count matches,
        print out name of match if there is one
    ii) print "No match" if there isn't
    int(x) turns string x into an integer
